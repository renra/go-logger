# Logger

This tool aims to provide a very simple leveled logging library. It allows you to define your own format of logging as well as your own log levels. It does not aim to be good or fast at object serialization. Give it strings, it's a logger. Instead it aims to make your hands free in case you want to rewrite the performance critical parts yourself.
